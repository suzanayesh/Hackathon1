## ExpressJS Application with AWS Rekognition Integration 
ExpressJS Computer Vision Project with AWS
Project Overview
This project is a showcase of leveraging AWS AI services, specifically AWS Rekognition, for image processing and text extraction. The application manages data using both a local database and AWS RDS for scalability, making it highly available and responsive. The user interface is built using ExpressJS, ensuring a user-friendly experience, and efficient file storage is enabled through AWS S3 integration.

### Technologies Utilized
- AWS SDK: We utilized the AWS SDK to interact with various AWS services, facilitating seamless integration into our application.

- AWS IAM key: An AWS IAM key was generated with full access to enable secure communication with AWS services.

- Rekognition SDK: We leveraged the Rekognition SDK to identify objects, scenes, actions, celebrities, and extract text from images.

- AWS RDS: Our database was initially managed locally and later migrated to AWS RDS, ensuring scalability and high availability.

- Auto Scaling Group (ASG): The application is hosted on an Auto Scaling Group, providing scalability by automatically adjusting resources based on demand.

- Load Balancer: A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances, enhancing application reliability and availability.

- ExpressJS Template Engine: We used ExpressJS's template engine to design a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

- AWS S3: AWS S3 integration was implemented to efficiently handle file storage, including uploaded images.
